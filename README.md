# laurenHetheringtonProjectThree

Welcome to the Kitten's Oubliette...

This is a text adventure game written in JavaScript, as Project 3 for Juno College. However, I built it to be reusable and expandable; all of the actual game content is stored in a json file at data/gameData.json. In terms of content, the sky is the limit! If you have the inclination, I encourage you to fork this repo and use it as a base for any silly text adventures you may wish to create.

A live version of this is available either here at https://laurheth.github.io/laurenHetheringtonProjectThree/ or at http://laurenhetherington.com/kittenOubliette/.
